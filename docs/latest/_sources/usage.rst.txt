Usage
======

This guide outlines how to use `pysdg`. The first section details the setup of the `json` file required for generating synthetic data. The second section covers the supported generative models. Subsequent sections provide examples demonstrating how to use `pysdg` in both `Python` and `R`. For a full list of functions and classes, refer to the :ref:`api_ref`. If youâ€™re ready to get started, and after installing `pysdg` as described in :ref:`installation`, you can explore the tutorial files available in the package's GitHub repository under the `tutorials` folder.

General setup
*************
1. Your tabular real dataset need to be provided as a `.csv` file. You also need to provide a `json` file describing the dataset variables. Below is an example of typical `json` file. Please note that the key values shall be replaced with your own:: 

    {
        "ds_name": "your_data_name",
        "nct_nos":[],
        "id_idx":[],
        "cat_idxs":[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12,13],
        "cnt_idxs":[9,14],
        "dscrt_idxs":[11,15],
        "datetime_idxs":[],
        "text_idxs":[],
        "miss_vals":["nan", "<NA>","NaT","NaN","NA",""],
        "h0_value":0,
        "quasi_idxs":[6,7],
        "strata_idxs":[]
    }


where the full description of the keys in the above `json` file is given below:

* ds_name: The name of the input real dataset that is typically representing a clinical trial.
* nct_nos: The NCT numbers of the clinical trial (optional).
* id_idx: The index of ID column (i.e. variable) in the dataset, if any. Please make sure to include the brackets. 

.. note:: Column indices shall start with 0, so the first column (variable) in the dataset has index `0`, the second column has index `1`, and so forth.

* cat_idxs: Indices of the `categorical` variables. **These include both numeric and alphanumeric variables**. Binary variables shall be listed here as well.  
* cnt_idxs: Indices of the `continuous` variables e.g. float numbers.
* dscrt_idxs: Indices of the `discrete` variables e.g. integer numbers.
* datetime_idxs: Indices of `date` or `date/time` variables e.g. The value 13-Jan-23 is an example of a date/time entry.
* text_idxs: Indices of `text` variables (currently not used, so please keep the list empty.)
* miss_vals: Values used for missing data. 

.. note:: Please make sure to include "nan", "NA" and "" in the list of missing values.

* h0_value: Keep always 0.
* quasi_idxs: Indices for `quasi identifiers` that are used in the calculations of attribution risk disclosure, if needed.  The risk calculation requires at least two variables to be listed.
* strata_idxs: Indices for the variables used for `stratification`, if any. 

.. note:: You can add other simple keys:value pairs to the json file without causing any error in `pysdg` package. 

2. In order to use `replica_seq` generator, the user needs to provide its access credentials in an `.env` file. The file should be saved in the root of users's project. This is necessary for the project to properly call the `replica_seq` generator. The following variables shall be set in the `.env` file::

    REPLICA_ID=<your_replica_user_id>
    REPLICA_PWD=<your_replica_user_password>
    REPLICA_HOST=<replica_host_ip_address>
    REPLICA_PORT=<replica_hots_port_number>


Supported generators
********************
`pysdg` supports the following generators with their source links:

1. "replica_seq". This a proprietary generator that requires the users to have their own license from `Aetion <https://aetion.com/>`_ (previously `Replica Analytics <https://news.aetion.com/aetion-acquires-synthetic-data-trailblazer-replica-analytics>`_).
2. `"synthcity_bayesian_network" <https://synthcity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/synthcity.plugins.generic.plugin_bayesian_network.html>`_.
3. `"synthcity_ctgan" <https://synthcity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/synthcity.plugins.generic.plugin_ctgan.html>`_.
4. `"synthcity_tvae" <https://synthcity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/synthcity.plugins.generic.plugin_tvae.html>`_
5. `"synthcity_rtvae" <https://synthcity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/synthcity.plugins.generic.plugin_rtvae.html>`_
6. `"synthcity_arf" <https://synthcity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/synthcity.plugins.generic.plugin_goggle.html>`_
7. `"synthcity_nflow" <https://synthcity.readthedocs.io/en/latest/generated/synthcity.plugins.generic.plugin_nflow.html>`_



Generating synthetic datasets in Python
***************************************
The example below illustrates the basic functionality of `pysdg` in Python. For advanced usage, please refer to the tutorial files. 

First activate your environment using::

    conda activate <your_virtual_environment_name>

Here's an example demonstrating how to use `pysdg` in `Python`:

.. code-block:: python

    from pysdg.synth.generate import Generator # Import pysdg generate module

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        
        raw_data_path='tutorials/raw_data.csv' # Replace the tutorial dataset path with your own.
        raw_info_path='tutorials/raw_info.json' # Replace the tutorial dataset info path with your own.
        gen_name="synthcity_bayesian_network" # Choose any of the supported generators.
        
        ##### Generate Synthetic Data
        gen=Generator(gen_name) # Construct the generator object
        real=gen.load(raw_data_path,raw_info_path) # Load raw data and its info.
        gen.train() # Train the selected generative model.
        gen.gen(num_rows=len(real), num_synths=2) # Generate a list of multiple synthetic datasets.
        synths=gen.unload() # Unload the generated synthetic datasets.
        synth[0].to_csv('synthetic_data.csv', index=False) # If needed, save the first synthetic dataset. Replace teh file name with your own.

.. note:: The above code snippets are illustrative and may require modifications to work with your own data.
        

Generating synthetic datasets in R
**********************************
The example below illustrates the basic functionality of `pysdg` in R. For advanced usage, please refer to the tutorial files. 

First activate your environment in R markdown notebook (Rmd) using::

    reticulate::use_condaenv(<your_virtual_environment_name>, required = TRUE)

Here's an example demonstrating how to use `pysdg` in `R`:

.. code-block:: R

    synth.generate <- reticulate::import("pysdg.synth.generate") # Import pysdg generate module
    
    raw_data_path <- "tutorials/raw_data.csv" # Replace the tutorial dataset path with your own.
    raw_info_path <- "tutorials/raw_info.json" # Replace the tutorial dataset info path with your own.
    gen_name <- "synthcity_bayesian_network"  # Choose any of the supported generators.

    ##### Generate Synthetic Data
    gen <- synth.generate$Generator(gen_name) # Construct the generator object
    real <- gen$load( data_path, info_path) # Load raw data and its info.
    gen$train() # Train the selected generative model.
    gen$gen(num_rows=nrow(soul), num_synths=2) # Generate a list of multiple synthetic datasets.
    synths <- gen$unload() # Unload the generated synthetic datasets.
    print(head(synths[[1]])) # If needed, save the first synthetic dataset. Replace the file name with your own.

.. note:: The above code snippets are illustrative and may require modifications to work with your own data.
