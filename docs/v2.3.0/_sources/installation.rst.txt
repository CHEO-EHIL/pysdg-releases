Installation
============

To install `pysdg`, you need to have access to `pysdg` project files at `OSF <https://osf.io/>`_. Please contact Khaled El Emam if you need access. 

The `pysdg` library can be used in `python` or `R`. The package is provided as a `wheel` file. Below are the details to install the library for each language.

Python
******
1. From your terminal, create your virtual environment using `conda` and make sure to specify the python version as `3.10.14` and the pip version as `24.0`, e.g. :: 

    conda create -n  <your_virtual_environment_name> python=3.10.14
    conda activate <your_virtual_environment_name>
    pip install pip==24.0

.. tip::

    If you are using RUNAI, it is advisable to create your Conda environment outside the pod, such as in your personal folder. This avoids the need to recreate the environment each time the pod is terminated. You can do this by specifying the --prefix option when creating the environment. For example, in any terminal, run:

    `conda create --prefix /share/personal/your_username/your_env_dir/your_env_name python=3.10.14`

    Afterward, when starting a new pod, you can direct Conda to look for environments in that folder by running:

    `conda config --add envs_dirs /share/personal/username/your_env_dir`

    Finally, activate the environment using:
    
    `conda activate your_env_name`


2. Sign on to your OSF account.

3. Download `pysdg` wheel file from `pysdg wheel file <https://osf.io/fdp9k>`_.

4. If needed, and if you have the necessary credentials, download Replica wheel file from `Replica wheel file <https://osf.io/7kaxb>`_.

5. Install `pysdg` and Replica (if needed) using:: 

    pip install <the_downloaded_pysdg_wheel_file>
    pip install <the_downloaded_replica_wheel_file>


6. If you intend to use the package in Jupyter Notebook, you need to add the above environment as a Jupyter kernel by issuing the following additional commands from your terminal:: 
    
    conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
    python -m ipykernel install --user --name=<your_virtual_environment_name>

Then from your Jupyter notebook, select the new kernel that was created based on your environment.


R
***

From your R `console`, execute teh following steps:

1. Install the package reticulate and the python version 3.10.14 through R. (Note: Installing python using reticulate may take a long time):

    .. code-block:: r

        devtools::install_version("reticulate", version = "1.38.0")
        reticulate::install_python(version="3.10.14")

    .. tip::

        Typically, if you are using `Rstudio` template when creating a `runai` job, installing `Python` should execute smoothly. However, in case you encounter any errors, then, from your RStudio `terminal`, try updating Linux using:

    .. code-block:: console

            sudo apt-get update
            sudo apt-get install -y build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev libncurses5-dev libgdbm-dev libnss3-dev libsqlite3-dev libreadline-dev libffi-dev libbz2-dev liblzma-dev
        

2. Install miniconda to create a conda environment::

    reticulate::install_miniconda()
    reticulate::conda_create("<your_virtual_environment_name>", python_version = "3.10.14")

3. Make sure you use the correct version of pip::

    reticulate::use_condaenv("<your_virtual_environment_name>")
    reticulate::conda_install("<your_virtual_environment_name>", packages = "pip==24.0", pip = FALSE) 

4. Sign on to your OSF account and Download the wheel files for both `pysdg` and Replica as mentioned above in 2,3 and 4 under Python installation.

5. Install pysdg within the conda environment:: 

    reticulate::conda_install("<your_virtual_environment_name>", "path_to_the_downloaded_pysdg_wheel_file", pip = TRUE, conda = "auto", python_version = "3.10")

6. Use the same environment above to install Replica using::

    reticulate::conda_install("<your_virtual_environment_name>", "path_to_the_downloaded_replica_wheel_file", pip = TRUE, conda = "auto", python_version = "3.10")
