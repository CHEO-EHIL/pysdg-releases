# Changelog

This file documents the notable changes to this project. Only selected versions are released.

## [2.4.4b4] - 2025-03-27
- **Fixed:** Error thrown by `calc_univar_hellinger_distance` when encoded columns of real and synth data do not match.
- **Fixed:** Median calculation in `calc_univar_hellinger_distance` when NA is encountered. 
- **Fixed:** Multivariate Hellinger distance datatime handling.
- **Added:** Inference risk privacy metric.
- **Added:** Vulnerability-utility metric.

## [2.4.4b3] - 2025-03-06
- **Added:** Default option to infer datatypes in addition to explicitly passing the JSON file for the input dataset in the `Generator` class.
- **Added:** Function to calculate multivariate Hellinger distance `calc_multivar_hellinger_distance`.
- **Deprecated:** Renamed the function `calc_mmbrshp_risk` to `calc_membership_risk`.
- **Deprecated:** Renamed the function `calc_univariate_hlngr_distance` to `calc_univar_hellinger_distance`.
- **Fixed:** Issue with "Failed to remove 'None'" in the `unload` method.
- **Added:** Support for specifying generator names in the format `source/generator` (e.g., `synthcity/ctgan`). The old format remains functional.
- **Added:** Introduced the `gen_params` attribute in `Generator` to allow users to define generator hyperparameters in the format used by the generator's source, replacing the `synthcity_params` attribute, which will eventually be deprecated.
- **Changed:** Redefined estimate agreement to indicate whether the synthetic data estimate falls within the confidence interval (CI) of the real data.

## [2.4.4b2] - 2025-02-07 (**RELEASED - BETA**)

- **Fixed:** The calculation of directional decision agreement.
- **Deprecated:** The `compare_estimates` function no longer returns an array. It now returns a dictionary instead. The array return is deprecated.

## [2.4.0b] - 2025-01-30

- **Fixed:** Corrected membership disclosure algorithm. **Note: The previous implementation resulted in inflated membership disclosure numbers, which means that if the disclosure value was low then the true value was definitely low.**

- **Fixed:** Cleared log handlers before starting pysdg.

## [2.3.0] - 2024-12-02 (**RELEASED - STABLE**)

- **Added:** `restore_col_names` method in `Generator` class to retrieve the encoded dataframe with original column names.

## [2.3.0rc0] - 2024-11-23

- **Added:**
  - Bayesian optimization feature for CTGAN, along with a tutorial.
  - Option to log output to a file.
  - Option to specify the maximum number of cores.
  - Detection of duplicate index entries in the json input file for the Generator.
- **Fixed:** Improved performance for handling erratic values in datasets.
- **Changed:** Replaced `no_obsvs` with `num_rows` and `no_synths` with `num_synths` in `Generator.gen` method.

## [2.2.0b] - 2024-09-26

- **Added:**
  - Standalone function to compute membership disclosure risk.
  - Function to remove unnecessary global variables.
